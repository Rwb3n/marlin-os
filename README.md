> **NOTE:** The files `home.html`, `journal.html`, `blog.html`, `style-guide.html`, and `styles.css` are **REFERENCE ONLY** and are **NOT PART OF PRODUCTION FILES**. They are provided for design and migration reference and are not used in the 11ty/Tailwind production build.

## Overview

Blue Marlin OS is a minimal design system and frontend implementation inspired by deep-sea interfaces, now being migrated to a modern tech stack combining Tailwind CSS and 11ty static site generator. This migration preserves the project's distinctive underwater aesthetic while improving maintainability, device optimization, and publishing workflow through GitHub Pages.

## ‚≠ê Priority: Preserving Visual Effects & Theme System

**The highest priority in this migration is the flawless preservation of Blue Marlin's signature visual effects and theme system.** These elements are the core identity of the project and must be maintained with perfect fidelity:

### Custom Animations & Effects
- **Light Shaft Effects**: The distinctive animated light shafts with variable opacity, blur, and movement must be perfectly preserved
- **Particle System**: The floating particles with randomized movement patterns will be carefully maintained
- **Water Ripple Effects**: The interactive mouse-based ripple effects that create an underwater feeling must function identically
- **Content Transitions**: All entrance/exit animations and hover effects will be replicated exactly

### Dual Theme System
- **Theme Toggle**: The smooth transition between themes with animated toggle knob must work flawlessly
- **Phase-Apex (Night)**: The deep blue-black theme with blue accents must maintain its exact color values and feel
- **Phase-Origin (Day)**: The light cream theme with orange accents must be precisely preserved
- **Theme-Specific Animations**: Different animation behaviors between themes (e.g., light shaft visibility) must work correctly

These visual elements will be implemented through carefully crafted Tailwind plugins with custom keyframe animations, maintaining the exact timing, easing, and visual properties of the original implementation. No compromise will be made on the fidelity of these effects.

## Project Emphasis

The project showcases a fictional operating system designed for deep-sea environments, with emphasis on:

- Dual theming system (day/night modes)
- Underwater-inspired visual effects
- Responsive design for various devices
- Accessibility features for different environments

## Minimalist Structure & Constraints

The project will maintain a deliberately minimalist structure with tight constraints:

- **Limited Page Types**: Only 2 page templates total:
  - 1 collection page type (for both project & blog lists)
  - 1 entry page type (for both project details & blog posts)
  
- **Fixed Landing Page**: The landing page section order and structure will remain unchanged
  
- **Constrained Layouts**: Only 3 layout options:
  - 1-column layout (mobile-first, full width)
  - 2-column layout (medium screens, content + sidebar)
  - 3-column layout (larger screens, grid-based)

These constraints enforce discipline in the design system and ensure the codebase remains focused and maintainable.

## Critical Development Rules

To maintain the highest quality throughout the migration, we've established these critical rules:

1. **UI Component Approval Required**: All UI components must be approved via a dedicated style guide and landing page prototype before any additional pages are developed.

2. **Quality Validation Gates**: Each step of the migration must pass a dedicated quality validation phase before proceeding to the next step.

3. **Comprehensive Code Annotations**: All HTML and CSS must be annotated in detail with explanatory comments documenting purpose, structure, and behavior.

4. **Modular CSS Structure**: CSS will be organized into smaller, more manageable files for easier maintenance and better organization.

5. **No Visual Compromises**: Each visual effect, animation, and theme element must match the original implementation with perfect fidelity.

6. **Migration Index Document**: A comprehensive migration index.md document must be maintained that catalogs all project components for AI reference, ensuring consistency and traceability.

7. **Code Generation Limits**: Code generation must be limited to chunks of 100 lines max to reduce tool errors, with appropriate error retry limits.

## Why Migrate to Tailwind & 11ty?

### Current Challenges

Our current implementation has served us well, but presents several challenges:

- **Device Optimization**: Manual media queries and conditional styling increase maintenance burden
- **Static Content Management**: Lack of a templating system makes content updates tedious

## Implementation Strategy for Visual Effects

To ensure flawless migration of the visual effects, we'll use a multi-phase approach:

1. **Analysis & Benchmarking**
   - Document all existing animations with precise timing, easing, and properties
   - Measure exact specifications for visual comparison testing
   - Create performance benchmarks to ensure the new implementation maintains or improves performance

2. **Custom Animation Plugin**
   - Develop a dedicated Tailwind plugin that extends the framework with our custom underwater effects
   - Preserve all original keyframe definitions with exact same properties and timing
   - Implement theme-specific variations to match current behavior
   - Add comprehensive annotations for all animation code

3. **Theme Toggle Implementation**
   - Create a seamless theme toggle that precisely matches current behavior
   - Ensure all theme-dependent styling transitions smoothly between modes
   - Maintain the current toggle animation with exact timing and movement
   - Document all theme variables with purpose annotations

4. **Visual Regression Testing**
   - Implement automated visual comparison tests to verify animations match exactly
   - Manual review with side-by-side comparisons of original and migrated animations
   - Device testing across multiple browsers and screen sizes

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Apply will-change hints identical to the current implementation
   - Use requestAnimationFrame and efficient CSS animations to maintain performance
   - Implement the same reduced-motion accommodations for accessibility
   - Document all optimization techniques with detailed comments

## Quality Validation Approach

Each step of the migration includes a dedicated quality validation phase that acts as a gate before proceeding:

1. **Visual Effects Validation**
   - Run visual comparison tests against original implementation
   - Verify all animations match original timing and behavior
   - Test theme toggle animation for accuracy
   - Validate performance against established benchmarks

2. **UI Component Validation**
   - Conduct side-by-side comparisons with original style guide
   - Test all interactive elements for identical behavior
   - Verify responsive behavior matches original implementation
   - Ensure consistent styling across all components

3. **Layout & Structure Validation**
   - Test layouts across all breakpoints
   - Verify correct grid behavior with sample content
   - Validate spacing consistency across layouts
   - Ensure thorough documentation of all layout code

4. **Final Pre-Launch Validation**
   - Perform end-to-end testing on staging environment
   - Conduct final visual inspection across devices
   - Test all interactive elements on live environment
   - Validate all animations and transitions in production

## CSS Organization Strategy

To improve maintainability, CSS will be organized into modular files:

1. **Base Styles**
   - Reset and normalization rules
   - Typography and global variables
   - Root-level theme configuration

2. **Component-Specific Styles**
   - Cards, navigation, buttons, etc.
   - Each component in its own file
   - Detailed annotations for each component

3. **Layout-Specific Styles**
   - Grid systems and containers
   - Responsive breakpoint behaviors
   - Spacing and positioning systems

4. **Theme-Specific Styles**
   - Day/night mode variables and overrides
   - Theme transition behaviors
   - Theme-specific animation variations

5. **Animation/Effects Styles**
   - Particles, light shafts, ripples
   - Keyframe definitions and animations
   - Performance optimizations

### Underwater Effects

All visual elements creating an immersive underwater atmosphere remain:
- Light shafts with variable opacity and positioning
- Floating particles with randomized movement
- Mouse-based water ripple effects
- Reduced effects on low-end devices (now with better performance detection)

### Page Templates & Structure

The deliberately constrained template structure:
- **Collection Template**: A single reusable template for both project grids and blog post lists
- **Entry Template**: A single reusable template for both project details and blog posts
- **Home Page**: Fixed section structure with hero, featured projects, and journal entries
- All templates maintain the distinctive underwater aesthetic across different content types

### Navigation & Layout

The responsive layout system follows the constrained approach:
- Three defined layout patterns (1, 2, and 3 columns) for all pages
- Desktop/mobile navigation with improved responsive behavior
- Glass-morphic containers with optimized backdrop filters
- Fixed landing page structure with consistent section ordering

### Accessibility Improvements

- Enhanced support for reduced motion preferences
